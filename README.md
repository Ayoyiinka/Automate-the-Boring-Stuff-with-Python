## Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python

# What motivated me to start programming?
Before I started programming, 
* I knew programming could enable me provide more efficient solutions *faster*.
* I had imaginations I wanted to bring into reality.
* I discovered the time put into carrying out tasks manually can be saved by automating the task.
* I was tired of boring tasks like data entry.

All of these was what motivated me to start programming.

# Why I chose Python?
I knew I loved brainstorming to uncover actionable insights that result in positive business outcomes; goal of data analytics.
October 2018, I decided to pursue a successful career as a Data Scientist. Based on my research, I discovered python was the most widely recommended programming language for data science. I had to trust my intuition and being able to learn the same language for both automation (scripting) and data science gave me so much satisfaction.

# Why Automate the Boring Stuff with Python?
I went back online on how to get started. I got several recommendations; Massive Open Online Course, Books, Youtube Channels. Since I am more comfortable with studying books, I did a more comprehensive research on what book to use in order not to get caught up in an infinite loop of learning introduction to python. I saw so many books with awesome reviews. However, I got so fascinated with the title; 'Automate the Boring stuff with Python' as this was part of what motivated me to consider learning programming. I got the book and read it like a self-help book in order to review its content matched the title. I am glad to tell you it did. Thank you **Al Sweigart** for this wonderful content.

Finally, this repository is dedicated to all the projects from the book as part of my journey as a pythonista.
